\section{Team Meeting Plan}

The team will meet multiple times a week, once during Monday tutorial time and throughout the week as issues or concerns arise. The meetings will be conducted either online through a Teams meeting or in-person on campus. The team
will hold an official meeting with the industry advisor once a week yet the time has not been decided. The meeting with the advisor will be online on Teams for the first 3 weeks, followed by in-person meetings later on. Meetings itself will be strutured as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Each member will take turns giving a short recap of work they have accomplished throughout the week.
  \item Members will voice any concerns or issues they may be facing.
  \item Team will form a discussion and make decisions for the project.
  \item Any/all questions will be documented for the next meeting with the advisor.
\end{enumerate}
The team will go ahead and use Issues on Github to add anything they may want to talk about in the next meeting as the week progresses in order to have some form of agenda for the next meeting.

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\textbf{Issues}: GitHub \\
\textbf{Meetings}: Microsoft Teams \\
\textbf{Meetings (with advisor)}: Discord \\
\textbf{Informal Project Discussion}: WhatsApp

\section{Team Member Roles}

\hspace{\parindent}As a team, we will all function as developers, sharing responsibilities
for creating issues, coding, testing, and documentation in the early stages. Specific roles
will be defined as the project evolves, allowing for flexibility and collaboration. \\

During our scheduled meetings (with the supervisor, within the team, etc.), we will follow
an Agile Scrum structure, incorporating additional roles such as Scrum Master and Scribe.
These roles will rotate weekly, with the Scrum Master responsible for organizing and leading
the meetings, and the Scribe tasked with documenting key details. This approach ensures active
participation and shared responsibility amongst team members. \\

We have chosen not to designate a team leader, as we all possess similar skills and knowledge.
Instead, we aim to work collaboratively to resolve any challenges that arise.

\section{Workflow Plan}

The repository will contain two main persistent branches (branching off main) throughout the project:
\textbf{dev} and \textbf{documentation}. These branches, that we will henceforth call "epic" branches, will be used for technical
software development and documentation changes respectively. \\

The average workflow for the project will proceed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Pull changes from the appropriate \textbf{epic} branch
  \item Create working branch from \textbf{epic} branch with the format [main contributor name]/[descriptive related to topic of changes]
  \item Create sub-working-branch from previous branch if necessary
  \item Commit changes with descriptive name
  \item Create \textbf{unit tests} for said changes
  \item Create pull request to merge changes from sub/working branch into working/epic branch
  \item Wait for all tests run with \textbf{GitHub Actions} to pass
  \item Wait for 2 approvals from teammates other than the one who created the Pull request
  \item Merge changes into target branch (working or epic)
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{GitHub Issues} will be used to track and manage bugs, feature requests, and development tasks. Team members can report issues, propose enhancements, and assign tasks to specific individuals. Each issue will be labelled (e.g., bug, enhancement, team-meeting) for easy categorisation, linked to relevant \textbf{milestones}, and tracked through \textbf{GitHub Project} boards. Comments and code references will be exploited to allow for collaboration and discussion on potential solutions. Issues will also be integrated with pull requests, so they’ll automatically close once fixes are merged. \\

\noindent
For situations where a certain type of issue is projected to be created at a steady frequency, templates will be created to facilitate their creation. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Milestones} will be used to organize commits and pull requests for major deliverables. Once all working branches associated to the milestone have been merged into the appropriate epic branch, the team will go through the relevant prepared checklist to make sure that all requirements have been met. Once this is done, the epic branch will be merged into main as one pull request along with the checklist. \\

\noindent
The \textbf{CI/CD} pipeline will be implemented via GitHub to improve automated testing as well as facilitate the feedback loop for the machine learning models used by the library. More detailed information will be added later. \\

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\hspace{\parindent} The project is hosted on GitHub under the organization of Sustainable Systems and Methods (SSM) Lab and can be accessed at this \href{https://github.com/ssm-lab/capstone--source-code-optimizer}{link}.

The team currently has one GitHub Project setup to serve as a visual tool not only to track deadlines for all tasks but also for accountability  for assigned tasks. The project can include cards for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Issues for course related deliverables
  \item Lecture and Meeting logs
  \item Issues for project specific tasks(such as building a certain component).
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
  details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
  libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
  the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
  libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
  of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
  it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
  choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
  implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
  project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Specific programming language
  \item Specific libraries
  \item Pre-trained models
  \item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
  \item Specific unit testing framework
  \item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
  \item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
    is not being done
  \item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
    appropriate
  \item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\subsubsection*{Mya Hussain Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the project?}

    Development plans act as good starting points by establishing clear objectives, recourse requirements, timelines and by assigning accountability within a project. It improves overall communication and understanding between members by solidifying the intent and requirements of a project. From my experience in industry, developers who don’t have a good grasp of what they’re developing and why they’re developing it typically deliver products that either fail to meet the primary goal or prove useless to the user. In real life, you develop products for people with various backgrounds. People of different disciplines speak in different technical tongues. Development plans are critical in syncing many people from various disciplines towards a common goal. They can also further can divide the roles and responsibilities between the developers and later aid in making development decisions that push progress towards the primary goals defined in the document.
  \item \textit{In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using CI/CD?}

    CI/CD or Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment is a two-step process where continuous integration means automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository for every commit, and continuous deployment involves keeping your code base deployable at any time.

    Key practices in CI/CD include automated testing and frequent commits. This leads to better code quality as bugs and conflicts between users are caught early on and easily rolled back or fixed near their date of creation. Another advantage is a faster time to market as code is integrated and deployed on development allowing teams to deliver features/fixes to users quicker. It also allows for improved collaboration through feedback as features pushed to shared repositories can be easily reviewed by the team.

    Disadvantages include the initial setup complexity of the CI/CD pipeline as this can be time consuming and a learning curve to those new to the process. It also requires a lot of maintenance and overhead to continuously commit, push, pull, test and merge code diverging from time that could be spent developing/improving a feature.

  \item \textit{What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any, and how did you resolve them?}

    I would be lying if I were to say that my team had disagreements during the first week of working on the project. The easy answer to this question is to make up a disagreement of low significance and say we worked through it using open democratic discussion and compromise. The truth is that it is too early in the project for us to be disagreeing with each other. We’re in our “honeymoon stage” where all members are excited to work on the project and are optimistic about the possible results we could achieve. Let us be in love during week one. We have many more weeks left to disagree.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Sevhena Walker}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the project?}

    When starting a project with a large scope, it is easy to get lost in all the features you want to implement in the project. By establish an action plan from the start, you allow yourself and your team to develop concrete goals and needs for your system. It is necessary to take a step back and analyze how exactly the components of your system are expected to interact with each other and what the end result is suppose to be.\\

    Without this planning stage, you are essentially going in blind with only a vague understanding and what you need to do. There is no way to organize task between team members efficiently either since specific components are sparsely detailed or non-existent. The project will be in a constant state of "debugging" you could say, constantly trying to figure out how this feature will work with the next and the next and so on. It would be like trying to build a house while only ever looking at the next couple meters in front of you.

  \item \textit{In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using CI/CD?}

    In CI/CD, there is a constant cycle of commiting code to a code base, and running automated tests on that piece of code before integrating it into the system. This constant and frequent cycle helps detect problems early leading toa more robust system. Furthermore, stress is taken away from the programmer when it comes to building and deploying software as it is all automated.\\

    The flip side to this is, of course, that the developer must initially set up the CI/CD environment. All the automated tests must first be written, and they must be written \textit{well}. The same goes for the build and deployment workflows. This setup can be complex and lengthy and most of all, it requires the developer to know how to do it. Furthermore, it must be \textit{maintained}. Other risks include a serious over-reliance in automation which could potentially introduce security flaws that weren't thought of before.

  \item \textit{What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any, and how did you resolve them?}

    I honestly cannot say that we had any disagreements as yet. Our team tried our best to discuss what our goals for the project were and everything was well communicated so that everyone was on the same page. We are at the beginning stages of a project that will implement technology is mostly new to us. We are excited, but also somewhat ignorant to some details which makes it hard to "disagree".
