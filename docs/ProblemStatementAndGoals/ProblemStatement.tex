\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

The expected challenge level of our project as general. This is due to the 
relatively straightforward technical knowledge required for its completion. 
The project primarily involves applying known software optimization and 
refactoring techniques, which are well-documented and accessible. 
Additionally, the required programming knowledge is in Python which known 
by all of the team members and was, taught in our undergraduate courses. 
Although the project does involve substantial development and research components, 
we anticipate the overall scope and depth of work to be manageable within the 
given timeframe.

To further enhance the project and address any potential gaps in the challenge level, 
we propose two additional activities: User Documentation and Usability Testing. 
These extras will allow us to provide support for future users of the tool and 
ensure that the tool meets user expectations and accessibility standards. 

Approval of the challenge level and extras will be discussed with the instructor, 
and adjustments may be made as needed throughout the term.

\subsubsection*{Ayushi Amin Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{What went well while writing this deliverable?}
    
      Writing the deliverable went quite well overall. The project itself was well defined and we were able to meet with the industry supervisor which helped clarify most of the details. Our team worked well together which helped each member to clarify any concerns particularly about the database we decided to use. Our team had some good discussions regarding making decisions on  what languages and tools to use in the project such as our decision to use MySQL for our database.

    \item \textit{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?}
    
    Not all the information was clarified or given by the supervisor at an early stage so writing this document took some time which caused us to delay working on this for a couple days. The team and I decided to consistently check in with the supervisor to encourage him to provide the required documents and information we needed as soon as possible. We used email as well as discord to directly reach out to the supervisor in which we finally ended up getting the information 2 days before the deadline and then crammed to finish the milestone documents.
    
\end{enumerate}  

\subsubsection*{Sevhena Walker Reflection}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What went well while writing this deliverable?}

    Right off the bat, I want to say that this deliverable was characterized by a great sense of \textit{discovery}. I learnt more about my team members and what there goals are. I learnt more about the project we had chosen and our supervisor's reasoning behind proposing it. I learnt new information on topics that were novel to me. This deliverable has filled me with a sense of excitement and a budding confidence that I hope will only continue to grow. \\
    
    There is much to learn about the project my team has chosen. Being able to go through the process of breaking it down and identifying what technologies will be used, and what features our system will have makes our project more concrete. Compared to the start of the project when things seemes more vague and daunting, there remains a sense that we will achieve what we have set out to do.
  \item \textit{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?}
  
    Of course, not everything is just sunshine and roses. Having to deconstruct a project with concepts that you are only vaguely familiar with can be an overwhelming task. While we were able to seek guidance from our supervisor, the onus was still on us to slowly unravel this new mass of information and piece it together in a coherent and structured manner. Our supervisor has been out of country and in a different time zone which has led to a gap in discourse. There were times when our team was left scratching our heads trying to figure out what the best way or, at the very least, what would be a \textit{suitable} way to plan out our project.

\subsubsection*{Nivetha Kuruparan Reflection}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What went well while writing this deliverable?}

    Writing this deliverable went smoothly and was an important learning experience for the team. 
    Meeting with our project supervisor early on helped us clarify the projectâ€™s scope and objectives, 
    making it easier to define the problem and outline the technical aspects. We had many discussions 
    about which tools and technologies to use, and these conversations helped solidify key decisions, 
    like selecting Python for the development language. By collaborating on this deliverable, it gave 
    us a better understanding of our team's strengths and priorities and sets a positive tone for the 
    project moving forward.

  \item \textit{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?}
  
    During this deliverable, we faced a few challenges related to efficiently planning a large software 
    project. One of the main pain points was learning how to set realistic goals that aligned with our 
    team's capabilities and timeline. Initially, there was a temptation to create our own refactoring 
    library from scratch in Rust (where no team member has experience in coding), which felt ambitious 
    and overwhelming as we considered the scope of the project.

    To resolve this, we decided to utilize the resources and guidance provided by our supervisor. By using 
    existing tools and libraries, we can focus on ensuring that the refactoring processes work effectively 
    without getting bogged down in the complexities of building everything from the ground up. This 
    experience reinforced the importance of planning when tackling large projects.

  \item \textit{How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly 
  ambitious but also of appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Group Answers Reflection}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly 
  ambitious but also of appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?}
  
  We carefully adjusted our project scope by focusing on the most important goals and prioritizing features that mattered most, while also 
  setting clear milestones to keep us on track. The feedback we got from our supervisor helped us refine our goals, making sure we were ambitious but
  also realistic about what we could achieve.
