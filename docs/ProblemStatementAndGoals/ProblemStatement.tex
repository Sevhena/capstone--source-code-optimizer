\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\textbf{Inputs:} Source code that requires refactoring for energy efficiency.
\textbf{Outputs:} Refactored code with reduced energy consumption, along with performance and energy consumption reports.

\subsection{Stakeholders}

\subsection{Environment}
\textbf{Programming Language:} Python will be the main language for developing refactoring tools and performing energy optimization.
\textbf{Reinforcement Learning Library: } Stable Baselines will be the library to implement reinforcement learning techniques.
\textbf{Developement Frameworks and Tools: } 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Github will be used for version control and for CI/CD integration to automate refactoring processes.
    \item Visual Studio Code will be the IDE used.
\end{enumerate} 
\textbf{Database: } MySQL will be the database used to store and retrieve data about refactoring and energy consumption metrics.

\wss{Hardware and software environment}

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    Ayushi - Writing the deliverable went quite well overall. The project itself was well defined and we were able to meet with the 
    industry supervisor which helped clarify most of the details. Our team worked well together which helped each memeber to clarify
    any concerns particularly about the database we decided to use. Our team had some good discussions regarding making decisions on 
    what languages and tools to use in the project such as our decision to use MySQL for our database.

    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?
    Ayushi - Not all the information was clarified or given by the supervisor at an early stage so writing this document took some 
    time which caused us to delay working on this for a couple days. The team and I decided to consistently check in with the supervisor
    to encourage him to provide the required documents and information we needed as soon as possible. We used email as well as discord to 
    directly reach out to the supervisor in which we finally ended up getting the information 2 days before the deadline and then crammed to 
    finish the milstone documents.

    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
    Team Response -
