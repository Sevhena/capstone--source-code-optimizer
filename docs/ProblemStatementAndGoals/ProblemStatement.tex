\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
  \href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.}

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\subsubsection*{\color{blue}{Direct Stakeholders}}
\textbf{[Software Developers]}: They will be the primary users of the refactoring library as they will be the ones to integrate the library into their code for better refactoring.\\

\noindent
\textbf{[Business Sustainability Teams]}: These teams are responsible for considering how a companies practices affect the environment. They will especially be interested in viewing the metrics provided by the library on how it improves the energy efficiency of software over time, therefore decreasing the burden on hardware and minimizing the company's environmental footprint.

\subsubsection*{\color{blue}{Indirect Stakeholders}}
\textbf{[Business Leaders]}: They focus on reducing operational costs associated with energy consumption, especially in large-scale or cloud-hosted applications. Use of the library in their products allows them to better achieve those goals. \\

\noindent
\textbf{[End Users]}: While not directly affected by this refactoring library, end users of technology that use the library will benefit from more responsive and efficient software that consumes less power, especially in mobile, embedded, or battery-dependent applications. \\

\noindent
\textbf{[Regulatory Bodies]}: They enforce energy consumption and sustainability standards, and ensure that software adheres to environmental regulations and may certify tools that meet efficiency requirements. Their oversight promotes the adoption of energy-efficient software practices.

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
  challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
  something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
  challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
  Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
  approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
  make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
  testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
  personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
  two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
  for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?

    \textit{}
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
