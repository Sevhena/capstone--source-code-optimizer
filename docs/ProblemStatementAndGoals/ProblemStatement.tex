\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

The expected challenge level of our project as general. This is due to the 
relatively straightforward technical knowledge required for its completion. 
The project primarily involves applying known software optimization and 
refactoring techniques, which are well-documented and accessible. 
Additionally, the required programming knowledge is in Python which known 
by all of the team members and was, taught in our undergraduate courses. 
Although the project does involve substantial development and research components, 
we anticipate the overall scope and depth of work to be manageable within the 
given timeframe.

To further enhance the project and address any potential gaps in the challenge level, 
we propose two additional activities: User Documentation and Usability Testing. 
These extras will allow us to provide support for future users of the tool and 
ensure that the tool meets user expectations and accessibility standards. 

Approval of the challenge level and extras will be discussed with the instructor, 
and adjustments may be made as needed throughout the term.

    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
