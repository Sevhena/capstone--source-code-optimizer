\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the

{problem statement checklist}.}

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
\subsubsection*{\color{blue}{Direct Stakeholders}}
\textbf{[Software Developers]}: They will be the primary users of the refactoring library as they will be the ones to integrate the library into their code for better refactoring.\\

\noindent
\textbf{[Dr. Istvan David (Supervisor)]}: Dr. David has a vested interest in the development of the system. He will play a crucial role in guiding and mentoring our team throughout the project. As the project supervisor, he will be the key advisor, offering feedback on technical aspects, project management, and research methodologies. \\

\noindent
\textbf{[Business Sustainability Teams]}: These teams are responsible for considering how a companies practices affect the environment. They will especially be interested in viewing the metrics provided by the library on how it improves the energy efficiency of software over time, therefore decreasing the burden on hardware and minimizing the company's environmental footprint.

\subsubsection*{\color{blue}{Indirect Stakeholders}}
\textbf{[Business Leaders]}: They focus on reducing operational costs associated with energy consumption, especially in large-scale or cloud-hosted applications. Use of the library in their products allows them to better achieve those goals. \\

\noindent
\textbf{[End Users]}: While not directly affected by this refactoring library, end users of technology that use the library will benefit from more responsive and efficient software that consumes less power, especially in mobile, embedded, or battery-dependent applications. \\

\noindent
\textbf{[Regulatory Bodies]}: They enforce energy consumption and sustainability standards, and ensure that software adheres to environmental regulations and may certify tools that meet efficiency requirements. Their oversight promotes the adoption of energy-efficient software practices.

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

The expected challenge level of our project as general. This is due to the 
relatively straightforward technical knowledge required for its completion. 
The project primarily involves applying known software optimization and 
refactoring techniques, which are well-documented and accessible. 
Additionally, the required programming knowledge is in Python which known 
by all of the team members and was, taught in our undergraduate courses. 
Although the project does involve substantial development and research components, 
we anticipate the overall scope and depth of work to be manageable within the 
given timeframe.

To further enhance the project and address any potential gaps in the challenge level, 
we propose two additional activities: User Documentation and Usability Testing. 
These extras will allow us to provide support for future users of the tool and 
ensure that the tool meets user expectations and accessibility standards. 

Approval of the challenge level and extras will be discussed with the instructor, 
and adjustments may be made as needed throughout the term.

    \textit{}
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
