\subsection{Personas}

\textbf{Persona 1} \\
Raven Reyes, a 34-year-old senior software developer, has over a decade of experience in backend development. Now working at a SaaS company focused on sustainability, Raven faces the challenge of reducing the energy consumption of their software. Manually refactoring code is time-consuming, especially when trying to pinpoint which parts of the code are draining the most energy. With tight deadlines and a need to balance sustainability with performance, Raven seeks a tool that automates energy-efficient refactoring and provides clear metrics. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Persona 2} \\
Draco Malfoy, a 29-year-old sustainability analyst at a large tech company, is tasked with reducing the environmental impact of the company’s operations. With expertise in corporate sustainability, Jordan’s role is to track and report energy consumption and carbon emissions, but they face challenges quantifying the data coming from the software development team. With the company's push toward greener technology, Jordan needs clear, easy-to-understand metrics on how the software team’s refactoring efforts are improving energy efficiency. Bridging the gap between the sustainability and development teams, Jordan relies on these insights to report progress on key sustainability goals to executives, ensuring that both technical improvements and environmental targets are aligned.
