\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}
The client of this project is \textbf{Dr. Istvan David} from McMaster's Department of Computing and Software. As the project supervisor, his role is to guide the development team with his technical and domain expertise. As the client, he sets the product's requirements and will be involved throughout its development. 
\subsection{Customer}
The customers of this product are all the \textbf{software developers} that use it to improve the energy efficiency of their codebase. They will be the primary users of the product and, therefore, will offer critical feedback on its effectiveness. Suggestions for improvement and/or additional features may come from this stakeholder. 

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{Maroon}{Project Managers}}
They oversee project operations and focus on reducing energy costs associated with large-scale or cloud-hosted applications. They might leverage the refactoring library to reduce operational costs and achieve business sustainability goals.

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{Maroon}{Business Sustainability Teams}}
This stakeholder is responsible for reducing their company's environmental footprint by analyzing its energy emissions. They will use the energy efficiency metrics provided by the refactoring library to improve environmental sustainability practices within their organization.

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{Maroon}{End Users}}
End users refer to the users of software that uses the product in its development. They will indirectly reap benefits from these applications that have been optimised using the refactoring library. They might experience more responsive, efficient software, particularly in mobile or embedded environments where battery life is a key concern. They have no involvement in the development of the product. 

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{Maroon}{Regulatory Bodies}}
This stakeholder is responsible for establishing regulations governing energy consumption and sustainability standards. They can promote the adoption of energy-efficient software practices and potentially certify tools that meet regulatory standards.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
