\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, an essential component of the global economy, is 
responsible for 2-4\% of global CO2 emissions today, with projections suggesting this could rise to 14\% by 
2040 ~\citep{BelkhirAndElmeligi2018}. To meet sustainability goals, including a 72\% reduction in CO2 
emissions by 2040 ~\citep{FreitagAndBernersLee2021}, this sector must find ways to improve energy efficiency.

One area of concern is the energy consumption of software systems. However, for software engineers, it is 
not practical for them to focus on optimizing energy consumption while developing complex programs. 
Instead, supporting tools and technologies are needed to assist in improving energy efficiency without 
altering the intended behaviour of the software.

This project aims to tackle Python, a popular but energy-inefficient programming language. Python consumes 
significantly more energy compared to more efficient languages like C and Rust—over 70 times more energy, 
on average, for similar tasks ~\citep{PereiraEtAl2017}. The project's goal is to develop tools to reduce 
Python's energy consumption through automated refactoring. While this will not solve the entire problem of 
the carbon footprint associated with the software, it is a step towards more energy-efficient practices in 
the software development process.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\noindent \textbf{Purpose}: The purpose of this project is to provide software engineers with tools to optimize 
the energy efficiency of Python programs by automating refactoring suggestions, while still allowing 
users to review and decide whether or not to apply the changes.

\noindent \textbf{Advantage}: By reducing the energy consumption of Python programs, this project will 
contribute to the broader effort of decreasing the carbon footprint of software development, supporting 
the ICT sector's goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 72\% by 2040 ~\citep{FreitagAndBernersLee2021}.

\noindent \textbf{Measurement}: The project's success can be measured by the reduction in energy usage 
achieved after applying the refactorings. Benchmarks will compare the energy consumption of original 
and refactored code, to achieve a measurable percentage reduction in energy consumption. The user's 
ability to make informed choices about whether to apply refactorings will also be evaluated through 
user feedback.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}

  The current software development landscape often prioritizes functionality and performance over energy efficiency. Many existing Python codebases are not optimized for energy consumption, leading to unnecessary power usage and increased carbon footprint. The following aspects characterize the current situation:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Manual Refactoring:} Developers typically perform refactoring manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
    \item \textbf{Limited Awareness:} Many developers lack awareness of energy-efficient coding practices and their impact on overall energy consumption.
    \item \textbf{Absence of Automated Tools:} There is a lack of widely adopted automated tools specifically designed to refactor Python code for energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Performance-Centric Optimization:} Most existing optimization tools focus on performance improvements rather than energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Code Patterns:} Many codebases contain inefficient code patterns that consume more energy than necessary.
  \end{enumerate}

  The project aims to address these issues by:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Automated Refactoring Library:} Developing a Python library that automatically detects and refactors code for improved energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{IDE Integration:} Creating a Visual Studio Code plugin that integrates the refactoring library, providing real-time suggestions and automated refactoring options.
    \item \textbf{Energy Consumption Measurement:} Implementing tools to measure and compare energy consumption before and after refactoring.
    \item \textbf{Developer Education:} Raising awareness about energy-efficient coding practices through the tool's suggestions and documentation.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Improvement:} Implementing a reinforcement learning model to improve refactoring suggestions over time based on developer feedback and real-world energy savings data.
  \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The introduction of the energy efficiency refactoring tool may lead to several changes in the current development environment. These effects include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The tool temporarily increasing CPU and memory usage while running. The tool aims to optimize energy efficency in code however it takes energy to run - in large codebases this could be significant energy and impact the performance of other applications running concurrently. 
  \item The tool may have it's own dependencies that now need to be included in the app or installed into the current system. Think Pysmells, Pyjoule etc.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Existing systems may need to be evaluated for compatibility with the new tool. Older versions of python or other needed dependencies may not support the tool.
  \item The refactoring process could lead to variations in the performance of existing applications
  \item As the tool updates existing code, thorough testing will be needed to ensure everything still works correctly. This may require more effort from QA teams and additional time and resources to check the updated code.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Users may face difficulties in understanding how to effectively utilize the tool, particularly if they are not familiar with concepts like code smells and refactoring techniques. This learning curve may lead to initial frustration or reduced productivity.
  \item Some users may be resistant to adopting new tools or processes, particularly if they perceive the existing workflows as sufficient. This resistance could hinder the tool's successful implementation and limit its overall effectiveness.
  \item Users may misinterpret the output reports generated by the tool, such as energy savings or performance metrics. If users do not fully understand how to interpret these results, it could lead to incorrect conclusions about the tool's impact on their code.
  \item There is a risk that users might become overly reliant on the tool for refactoring without fully understanding the underlying principles. This could result in poor coding practices if users do not engage in thoughtful analysis of the suggested changes.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Limited Computational Resources:} Environments with restricted computational power may face challenges when running the tool, especially for large codebases. Limited resources could result in longer processing times or failures during analysis and refactoring.
  \item \textbf{Lack of Test Coverage:} If existing codebases lack comprehensive test suites, validating the functionality of refactored code may become challenging. Without adequate tests, it will be difficult to ensure that the tool's changes do not introduce new issues.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Ongoing Maintenance:} The tool will need regular updates to stay compatible with new programming languages or standards, adding to the workload.
  \item \textbf{Performance Trade-offs:} Users may find that while some refactorings improve energy efficiency, they could negatively impact other performance metrics, such as execution speed.
\end{enumerate}
