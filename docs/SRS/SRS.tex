\wss{The team will meet multiple times a week, once during Monday tutorial time and throughout the week as issues or concerns arise. The meetings will be conducted either online through a Teams meeting or in-person on campus. The team
will hold an official meeting with the industry advisor once a week yet the time has not been decided. The meeting with the advisor will be online on Teams for the first 3 weeks, followed by in-person meetings later on. Meetings itself will be strutured as follows: 
1. Each member will take turns giving a short recap of work they have accomplished throughout the week.
2. Members will voice any concerns or issues they may be facing.
3. Team will form a discussion and make decisions for the project.
4. Any/all questions will be doucmented for the next meeting with the advisor.

The team will go ahead and use Issues on Github to add anything they may want to talk about in the next meeting as the week progresses in order to have some form of agenda for the next meeting.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

Issues on GitHub, Microsoft Teams for meetings, Discord for meetings with the advisor online, WhatsApp for informal project discussion.
\section{Tasks}
\subsection{Project Planning}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
