\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, an essential component of the global economy, is 
responsible for 2-4\% of global CO2 emissions today, with projections suggesting this could rise to 14\% by 
2040 ~\citep{BelkhirAndElmeligi2018}. To meet sustainability goals, including a 72\% reduction in CO2 
emissions by 2040 ~\citep{FreitagAndBernersLee2021}, this sector must find ways to improve energy efficiency.

One area of concern is the energy consumption of software systems. However, for software engineers, it is 
not practical for them to focus on optimizing energy consumption while developing complex programs. 
Instead, supporting tools and technologies are needed to assist in improving energy efficiency without 
altering the intended behaviour of the software.

This project aims to tackle Python, a popular but energy-inefficient programming language. Python consumes 
significantly more energy compared to more efficient languages like C and Rust—over 70 times more energy, 
on average, for similar tasks ~\citep{PereiraEtAl2017}. The project's goal is to develop tools to reduce 
Python's energy consumption through automated refactoring. While this will not solve the entire problem of 
the carbon footprint associated with the software, it is a step towards more energy-efficient practices in 
the software development process.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\noindent \textbf{Purpose}: The purpose of this project is to provide software engineers with tools to optimize 
the energy efficiency of Python programs by automating refactoring suggestions, while still allowing 
users to review and decide whether or not to apply the changes.

\noindent \textbf{Advantage}: By reducing the energy consumption of Python programs, this project will 
contribute to the broader effort of decreasing the carbon footprint of software development, supporting 
the ICT sector's goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 72\% by 2040 ~\citep{FreitagAndBernersLee2021}.

\noindent \textbf{Measurement}: The project's success can be measured by the reduction in energy usage 
achieved after applying the refactorings. Benchmarks will compare the energy consumption of original 
and refactored code, to achieve a measurable percentage reduction in energy consumption. The user's 
ability to make informed choices about whether to apply refactorings will also be evaluated through 
user feedback.

\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}
The client of this project is \textbf{Dr. Istvan David} from McMaster's Department of Computing and Software. As the project supervisor, his role is to guide the development team with his technical and domain expertise. As the client, he sets the product's requirements and will be involved throughout its development. 
\subsection{Customer}
The customers of this product are all the \textbf{software developers} that use it to improve the energy efficiency of their codebase. They will be the primary users of the product and, therefore, will offer critical feedback on its effectiveness. Suggestions for improvement and/or additional features may come from this stakeholder. 

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{Maroon}{Project Managers}}
They oversee project operations and focus on reducing energy costs associated with large-scale or cloud-hosted applications. They might leverage the refactoring library to reduce operational costs and achieve business sustainability goals.

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{Maroon}{Business Sustainability Teams}}
This stakeholder is responsible for reducing their company's environmental footprint by analyzing its energy emissions. They will use the energy efficiency metrics provided by the refactoring library to improve environmental sustainability practices within their organization.

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{Maroon}{End Users}}
End users refer to the users of software that uses the product in its development. They will indirectly reap benefits from these applications that have been optimised using the refactoring library. They might experience more responsive, efficient software, particularly in mobile or embedded environments where battery life is a key concern. They have no involvement in the development of the product. 

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{Maroon}{Regulatory Bodies}}

\subsection{Personas}

\textbf{Persona 1} \\
Raven Reyes, a 34-year-old senior software developer, has over a decade of experience in backend development. Now working at a SaaS company focused on sustainability, Raven faces the challenge of reducing the energy consumption of their software. Manually refactoring code is time-consuming, especially when trying to pinpoint which parts of the code are draining the most energy. With tight deadlines and a need to balance sustainability with performance, Raven seeks a tool that automates energy-efficient refactoring and provides clear metrics. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Persona 2} \\
Draco Malfoy, a 29-year-old sustainability analyst at a large tech company, is tasked with reducing the environmental impact of the company’s operations. With expertise in corporate sustainability, Jordan’s role is to track and report energy consumption and carbon emissions, but they face challenges quantifying the data coming from the software development team. With the company's push toward greener technology, Jordan needs clear, easy-to-understand metrics on how the software team’s refactoring efforts are improving energy efficiency. Bridging the gap between the sustainability and development teams, Jordan relies on these insights to report progress on key sustainability goals to executives, ensuring that both technical improvements and environmental targets are aligned.

\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
\textbf{Key Users:} Software Developers, Business Sustainability Teams \\
\textbf{Secondary User:} Project Managers

\subsection{User Participation}
For the bulk of the development process, requirements will be gathered from the development team itself with the help of the project supervisor, Dr. Istvan David.

During the testing phase, usability testing will be conducted to further refine the product.

\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
Due to the nature of this project as a capstone requirement, there are currently no expected maintenance users.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}

  The current software development landscape often prioritizes functionality and performance over energy efficiency. Many existing Python codebases are not optimized for energy consumption, leading to unnecessary power usage and increased carbon footprint. The following aspects characterize the current situation:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Manual Refactoring:} Developers typically perform refactoring manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
    \item \textbf{Limited Awareness:} Many developers lack awareness of energy-efficient coding practices and their impact on overall energy consumption.
    \item \textbf{Absence of Automated Tools:} There is a lack of widely adopted automated tools specifically designed to refactor Python code for energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Performance-Centric Optimization:} Most existing optimization tools focus on performance improvements rather than energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Code Patterns:} Many codebases contain inefficient code patterns that consume more energy than necessary.
  \end{enumerate}

  The project aims to address these issues by:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Automated Refactoring Library:} Developing a Python library that automatically detects and refactors code for improved energy efficiency.
    \item \textbf{IDE Integration:} Creating a Visual Studio Code plugin that integrates the refactoring library, providing real-time suggestions and automated refactoring options.
    \item \textbf{Energy Consumption Measurement:} Implementing tools to measure and compare energy consumption before and after refactoring.
    \item \textbf{Developer Education:} Raising awareness about energy-efficient coding practices through the tool's suggestions and documentation.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Improvement:} Implementing a reinforcement learning model to improve refactoring suggestions over time based on developer feedback and real-world energy savings data.
  \end{enumerate}
